# Leaflet_Census_API
Map of U.S. states created using the Census API for demo purposes.
The map will not be populated with census data unless the **censusApiKey** variable in the Fetch_Data_from_Census_API.js script is changed to a valid census API key (https://api.census.gov/data/key_signup.html).
